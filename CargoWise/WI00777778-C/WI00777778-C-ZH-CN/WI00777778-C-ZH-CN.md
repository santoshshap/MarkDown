### Summary

When autorating revenue for FSA Shipment, the Transport Mode and Container Mode of the attached Consol can be respected when matching revenue rates. This feature can be configured through a system registry.

### Description

The content author is responsible for creating high-quality images, including any highlight boxes and arrows at are used in Update Notes. Special care should be taken when creating screenshots and applying the highlight elements, as screen resolution can affect clarity and accurate sizing.

To achieve best and consistent results for displaying screenshot images the Academy uses “x2 images”. The term "x2 images" typically refers to digital image assets that have twice the pixel dimensions (double the width and double the height) of standard (1x) images. This is done to ensure images appear sharp and clear on high-resolution displays.
Image width options

Use CSS [reference](https://discourse.devontechnologies.com/t/markdown-a-simple-method-for-scaling-images/70035)

## 1720 image width - x2 = 100%

# HTML

## 1720 with with HTML constraining to 860

<img src="_images/WI00777778-C-ZH-CN.3.png" width="860" height="744">

## 860 with HTML constraining to 430

<img src="_images/WI00777778-C-ZH-CN.5.png" width="430" height="372">

Harry's Dev Ops option prevents the display of the image.

![860](_images/Screenshot-860px.png =430x372)

I have also seen these options sprooked as solutions:

![860](_images/Screenshot-860px.png | width=430)

![860](_images/Screenshot-860px.png =430x372)

| Insert a 1200 px wide image into a table | On-page display |
|----------------|------------------|
|1720|100% column width|
|860|![1200](_images/WI00777778-C-ZH-CN.1.png)|
|430|25% column width|
