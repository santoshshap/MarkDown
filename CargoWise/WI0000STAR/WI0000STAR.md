##### **Update Note**

# Test UPN

## Advanced Order Manager

##### 25 September 2025  

***

### Summary

Supplier bookings with the load modes ‘Other’ and ‘Loose Cargo’ along with their associated records are now visible in the Order Explorer (OE) grid. Lets see these changes are showing here. Can we keep adding more changes and saving the changes.

### Description

Supplier bookings with load modes of ‘Other’ or ‘Loose Cargo’ and their associated Advanced Order Manager (AOM) records were not available in Order Explorer (OE) grid.

> [!IMPORTANT]
I want to add text here. Supplier bookings with load modes of ‘Other’ or ‘Loose Cargo’ used to be known as Loose Cargo (LSE). Refer to the Simplified Load Mode in NEO portal for the load mode’s previous naming conventions.

 They have now been added in this update with the addition of the following non-default sortable
columns and filters:

- Dispatched Qty + UOM
- Dispatched Packages + UOM
